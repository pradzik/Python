5 Gyres is an organization aimed at reducing plastics pollution. They have traveling exhibits, and summarize topic relevant research. Their traveling activities include stops at universities and educational discussions.
5 Gyres was one of two organizations that recently researched the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. They also presented their results at the Aquarium of the Pacific and have been cited as a source for estimating the size of the gyres. 5 Gyres explained their activities at a National Aquarium radio broadcast, has been featured at the Two Oceans Aquarium website, and has prepared, along with the Goody Awards, tips on how to reduce plastic consumption. 5 Gyres has also worked with environmental artist Marina DeBris in using trashion to help raise awareness of ocean trash.
5 Gyres was founded by Anna Cummins and Marcus Eriksen. Eriksen and Cummins have been featured speakers at universities and in news stories. Anna Cummins has also been awarded the Golden Goody Award, during a meeting of the Los Angeles chapter of the USNC for UN WOMEN First Annual Special Assembly.
Before founding 5 Gyres, Cummins and Eriksen had worked at the Algalita Marine Research Foundation, with founder Charles J. Moore, who is currently a scientific advisor for 5 Gyres.
