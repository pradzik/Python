Vesta, minor-planet designation 4 Vesta, is one oflargest objectsthe asteroid belt, with a mean diameter of 525 kilometres (326 mi). It was discovered byGerman astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers29 March 1807is named after Vesta,virgin goddess of homehearth from Roman mythology.
Vesta issecond-most-massive objectthe asteroid belt afterdwarf planet Ceres,it contributes an estimated 9% ofmass ofasteroid belt. Vesta issecond-largest asteroid, only slightly larger than Pallas, but significantly more massive. Vesta islast remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) ofkind that formedterrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions onetwo billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite eucrite diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich source of information about Vesta.
Vesta isbrightest asteroid visible from Earth. Its maximum distance fromSun is slightly greater thanminimum distance of Ceres fromSun, though its orbit lies entirely within that of Ceres.
NASA's Dawn spacecraft entered orbit around Vesta16 July 2011 for a one-year explorationleft orbit5 September 2012 en route to its final destination, Ceres. Researchers continue to examine data collected by Dawn for additional insights intoformationhistory of Vesta.




Heinrich Olbers discovered Pallas1802,year afterdiscovery of Ceres. He proposed thattwo objects wereremnants of a destroyed planet. He sent a letter with his proposal toEnglish astronomer William Herschel, suggesting that a search nearlocations whereorbits of CeresPallas intersected might reveal more fragments. These orbital intersections were locatedthe constellations of CetusVirgo. Olbers commenced his search1802, and29 March 1807 he discovered Vestathe constellation Virgo a coincidence, because Ceres, Pallas,Vesta are not fragments of a larger body. Becauseasteroid Juno had been discovered1804, this made Vestafourth object to be identifiedthe region that is now known asasteroid belt. The discovery was announceda letter addressed to German astronomer Johann H. Schr ter dated 31 March. Because Olbers already had credit for discovering a planet (Pallas; attime,asteroids were considered to be planets), he gavehonor of naming his new discovery to German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, whose orbital calculations had enabled astronomers to confirmexistence of Ceres,first asteroid,who had computedorbit ofnew planetthe remarkably short time of 10 hours. Gauss decidedthe Roman virgin goddess of homehearth, Vesta.



Vesta wasfourth asteroid to be discovered, hencenumber 4its formal designation. The name Vesta, or national variants thereof, isinternational use with two exceptions: GreeceChina. In Greek,name adopted wasHellenic equivalent of Vesta, Hestia (4  );English, that name is used for 46 Hestia (Greeks usename "Hestia" for both, withminor-planet numbers used for disambiguation). In Chinese, Vesta is called'hearth-god(dess) star',   z osh nx ng,contrast togoddess Vesta, who goes by her Latin name.
Upon its discovery, Vesta was, like Ceres, Pallas,Juno before it, classified as a planetgiven a planetary symbol. This symbol,  , representsaltar of Vesta with its sacred firewas designed by Gauss. In Gauss's conception, this was drawn ;its modern form, it is .
Afterdiscovery of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38 years, andSolar System was thought to have eleven planets. However,1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace,by 1851 there were fifteen, each with its own symbol,addition toeight major planets (Neptune had been discovered1846). It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely,some ofexisting ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year,problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who suggested numbering asteroidstheir order of discovery,placing this numbera disk (circle) asgeneric symbol of an asteroid. Thus,fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquiredgeneric symbol  . This was soon coupled withname into an official number name designation,   Vesta, asnumber of minor planets increased. By 1858,circle had been simplified to parentheses, (4) Vesta, which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as 4) Vesta4, Vesta, was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949. Today, either Vesta, or, more commonly, 4 Vesta, is used.



Photometric observations of Vesta were made atHarvard College Observatory1880 1882atObservatoire de Toulouse1909. Theseother observations allowedrotation rate of Vesta to be determined by1950s. However,early estimates ofrotation rate came into question becauselight curve included variationsboth shapealbedo.
Early estimates ofdiameter of Vesta ranged from 383 (in 1825) to 7005444000000000000 444 km. E.C. Pickering produced an estimated diameter of 7005513000000000000 513 17 km1879, which is close tomodern value formean diameter, butsubsequent estimates ranged from a low of 7005390000000000000 390 km up to a high of 7005602000000000000 602 km duringnext century. The measured estimates were basedphotometry. In 1989, speckle interferometry was used to measure a dimension that varied between 4987005548000000000000 548 km duringrotational period. In 1991, an occultation ofstar SAO 93228 by Vesta was observed from multiple locationsthe eastern United StatesCanada. Basedobservations from 14 different sites,best fit todata was an elliptical profile with dimensions of about 7005550000000000000 550 km   7005462000000000000 462 km. Dawn confirmed this measurement.
Vesta becamefirst asteroid to have its mass determined. Every 18 years,asteroid 197 Arete approaches within 7009598391482800000 0.04 AU of Vesta. In 1966, based upon observations of Vesta's gravitational perturbations of Arete, Hans G. Hertz estimatedmass of Vesta as 6990120000000000000 (1.20 0.08) 10 10 solar masses. More refined estimates followed, and2001perturbations of 17 Thetis were used to estimatemass of Vesta as 6990131000000000000 (1.31 0.02) 10 10 solar masses.



Vesta follows an orbit between MarsJupiter, withinasteroid belt, with a period of 3.6 Earth years. The orbit is moderately inclined (i = 7.1  compared to 7  for Mercury17  for Pluto)moderately eccentric (e = 0.09 compared to 0.09 for Mars).
True orbital resonances between asteroids are considered unlikely; due to their small masses relative to their large separations, such relationships should be very rare. Nevertheless, Vesta is able to capture other asteroids into temporary 1:1 resonant orbital relationships (for periods up to 2 million years or more); about forty objects have been identified. Decameter-sized objects detectedthe vicinity of Vesta by Dawn may be such quasi-satellites rather than proper satellites.



Its rotation is relatively fast for an asteroid (5.342 h)prograde, withnorth pole pointingthe direction of right ascension 20 h 32 min, declination +48  (inconstellation Cygnus) with an uncertainty of about 10 . This gives an axial tilt of 29 .




There are two longitudinal coordinate systemsuse for Vesta, with prime meridians separated by 150 . The IAU established a coordinate system1997 basedHubble photos, withprime meridian running throughcenter of Olbers Regio, a dark feature 200 km across. When Dawn arrived at Vesta, mission scientists found thatlocation ofpole assumed byIAU was off by 10 , so thatIAU coordinate system drifted acrosssurface of Vesta at 0.06  per year,also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close,so was not adequate to defineprime meridian withprecision they needed. They correctedpole, but also established a new prime meridian 4  fromcenter of Claudia, a sharply defined crater 700 meters across, which they say resultsa more logical set of mapping quadrangles. All NASA publications, including imagesmaps of Vesta, useClaudian meridian, which is unacceptable toIAU. The IAU Working GroupCartographic CoordinatesRotational Elements recommended a coordinate system, correctingpole but rotatingClaudian longitude by 150  to coincide with Olbers Regio. It was accepted byIAU, though it disruptsmaps prepared byDawn team, which had been positioned so they would not bisect any major surface features.




Vesta issecond-most-massive bodythe asteroid belt, though only 28% as massive as Ceres. The density is lower thanfour inner planets but higher than most asteroidsall ofmoonsthe Solar System (except Io). The surface area is aboutsame as that of Pakistan (about 800,000 square kilometers). Vesta orbitsthe inner asteroid belt interior toKirkwood gap at 2.50 AU. It has a differentiated interior. Vesta is only slightly larger (7005525400000000000 525.4 0.2 km) than 2 Pallas (7005512000000000000 512 3 km)volume, but is about 25% more massive.
Vesta's shape is close to a gravitationally relaxed oblate spheroid, butlarge concavityprotrusion atsouthern pole (see 'Surface features' below) combined with a mass less than 7020500000000000000 5 1020 kg precluded Vesta from automatically being considered a dwarf planet under International Astronomical Union (IAU) Resolution XXVI 5. A recent analysis of Vesta's shapegravity field using data gathered byDawn spacecraft has shown that Vesta is currently nothydrostatic equilibrium.
Temperaturesthe surface have been estimated to lie between about  20  C withSun overhead, dropping to about  190  C atwinter pole. Typical daytimenighttime temperatures are  60  C 130  C respectively. This estimate is for 6 May 1996, very close to perihelion, although details vary somewhat withseasons.




Prior toarrival ofDawn spacecraft, some Vestan surface features had already been resolved usingHubble Space Telescopeground-based telescopes (e.g.Keck Observatory). The arrival of DawnJuly 2011 revealedcomplex surface of Vestadetail.




The most prominent of these surface features are two enormous craters,500-kilometre (310 mi)-wide Rheasilvia crater, centered nearsouth pole, and400 kilometres (250 mi) wide Veneneia crater. The Rheasilvia crater is youngeroverliesVeneneia crater. The Dawn science team namedyounger, more prominent crater Rheasilvia, aftermother of RomulusRemusa mythical vestal virgin. Its width is 95% ofmean diameter of Vesta. The crater is about 19 kilometres (12 mi) deep. A central peak rises 23 km abovelowest measured part ofcrater floor andhighest measured part ofcrater rim is 31 km abovecrater floor low point. It is estimated thatimpact responsible excavated about 1% ofvolume of Vesta,it is likely thatVesta familyV-type asteroids areproducts of this collision. If this iscase, thenfact that 10-km fragments have survived bombardment untilpresent indicates thatcrater is at most only about 1 billion years old. It would also besite of origin ofHED meteorites. Allknown V-type asteroids taken together account for only about 6% ofejected volume, withrest presumably eithersmall fragments, ejected by approaching3:1 Kirkwood gap, or perturbed away byYarkovsky effect or radiation pressure. Spectroscopic analyses ofHubble images have shown that this crater has penetrated deep through several distinct layers ofcrust,possibly intomantle, as indicated by spectral signatures of olivine.
The large peak atcenter of Rheasilvia is 20 to 25 kilometres (12 16 mi) high180 kilometres (110 mi) wide.




Several old, degraded craters rival RheasilviaVeneneiasize, though none are quite so large. They include Feralia Planitia, shown at right, which is 270 km across. More-recent, sharper craters range up to 158 kilometres (98 mi) Varronilla196 kilometres (122 mi) Postumia.



The "snowman craters" is an informal name given to a group of three adjacent cratersVesta's northern hemisphere. Their official names from largest to smallest (west to east) are Marcia, Calpurnia,Minucia. Marcia isyoungestcross-cuts Calpurnia. Minucia isoldest.



The majority ofequatorial region of Vesta is sculpted by a series of concentric troughs. The largest is named Divalia Fossa (10 20 km wide, 465 km long). Despitefact that Vesta is a one-seventhsize ofMoon, Divalia Fossa dwarfsGrand Canyon. A second series, inclined toequator, is found further north. The largest ofnorthern troughs is named Saturnalia Fossa (  40 km wide, > 370 km long). These troughs are thought to be large-scale graben resulting fromimpacts that created RheasilviaVeneneia craters, respectively. They are some oflongest chasmsthe Solar System, nearly as long as Ithaca ChasmaTethys. The troughs may be graben that formed after another asteroid collided with Vesta, a process that can happen onlya body that, like Vesta, is differentiated. Vesta's differentiation is one ofreasonsscientists consider it a protoplanet.



Compositional information fromvisibleinfrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-rayneutron detector (GRaND),framing camera (FC), all indicate thatmajority ofsurface composition of Vesta is consistent withcomposition ofhowardite, eucrite,diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richestdiogenite, consistent withRheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine withinRheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detectedlocalized regions ofnorthern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.



Pitted terrain has been observedfour cratersVesta: Marcia, Cornelia, NumisiaLicinia. The formation ofpitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along withpitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are foundMarciaCornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies endlobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain,are proposed to form bytransient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted byheat ofimpacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was depositedthe surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively richmineralogically bound OH.




There is a large collection of potential samples from Vesta accessible to scientists,the form of over 1200 HED meteorites (Vestan achondrites), giving insight into Vesta's geologic historystructure. NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (NASA IRTF) studies of asteroid (237442) 1999 TA10 suggest that it originated from deeper within Vesta thanHED meteorites
Vesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron nickel core 214 226 kmdiameter, an overlying rocky olivine mantle, with a surface crust. Fromfirst appearance of calcium aluminium-rich inclusions (the first solid matterthe Solar System, forming about 4.567 billion years ago), a likely time line is as follows:

Vesta isonly known intact asteroid that has been resurfacedthis manner. Because of this, some scientists refer to Vesta as a protoplanet. However,presence of iron meteoritesachondritic meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that there once were other differentiated planetesimals with igneous histories, which have since been shattered by impacts.

Onbasis ofsizes of V-type asteroids (thought to be pieces of Vesta's crust ejected during large impacts), anddepth of Rheasilvia crater (see below),crust is thought to be roughly 10 kilometres (6 mi) thick. Findings fromDawn spacecraft have found evidence thattroughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta could have been classified as a dwarf planet if it had retained a spherical shape,it has other qualities that lead tothought it could be a protoplanet. The only thing that knocked it out ofcategory of a dwarf planet wasformation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. Attime of these impacts Vesta was not warmplastic enough to return to a shapehydrostatic equilibrium.



Vesta's surface is covered by regolith distinct from that foundthe Moon or asteroids such as Itokawa. This is because space weathering acts differently. Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of nanophase iron becauseimpact speedsVesta are too low to make rock meltingvaporization an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by brecciationsubsequent mixing of brightdark components. The dark component is probably due toinfall of carbonaceous material, whereasbright component isoriginal Vesta basaltic soil.



Some small Solar System bodies are suspected to be fragments of Vesta caused by impacts. The Vestian asteroidsHED meteorites are examples. The V-type asteroid 1929 Kollaa has been determined to have a composition akin to cumulate eucrite meteorites, indicating its origin deep within Vesta's crust.
Vesta is currently one of only six identified Solar System bodies of which we have physical samples, coming from a number of meteorites suspected to be Vestan fragments. It is estimated that 1 out of 16 meteorites originated from Vesta. The other identified Solar System samples are from Earth itself, meteorites from Mars,samples returned fromMoon,comet Wild 2, andasteroid 25143 Itokawa.




In 1981, a proposal for an asteroid mission was submitted toEuropean Space Agency (ESA). NamedAsteroidal Gravity OpticalRadar Analysis (AGORA), this spacecraft was to launch some time1990 1994perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reachasteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or by means of a small ion engine. However,proposal was refused byESA. A joint NASA ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion (MAOSEP), with one ofmission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interestedan asteroid mission. Instead,ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions toasteroid belt were proposedthe 1980s by France, Germany, Italy andUnited States, but none were approved. Exploration of Vesta by fly-byimpacting penetrator wassecond main target offirst plan ofmulti-aimed Soviet Vesta mission, developedcooperation with European countries for realisation1991 1994 but canceled due toSoviet Union disbanding.

Inearly 1990s, NASA initiatedDiscovery Program, which was intended to be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996,program's study team recommended as a high priority a mission to exploreasteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004Dawn vehicle had passed its critical design reviewconstruction proceeded.
It launched27 September 2007 asfirst space mission to Vesta. On 3 May 2011, Dawn acquired its first targeting image 1.2 million kilometers from Vesta. On 16 July 2011, NASA confirmed that it received telemetry from Dawn indicating thatspacecraft successfully entered Vesta's orbit. It was scheduled to orbit Vesta for one year, until July 2012. Dawn ' s arrival coincided with late summerthe southern hemisphere of Vesta, withlarge crater at Vesta's south pole (Rheasilvia)sunlight. Because a seasonVesta lasts eleven months,northern hemisphere, including anticipated compression fractures oppositecrater, would become visible to Dawn's cameras before it left orbit. Dawn left orbit around Vesta4 September 2012 11:26 p.m. PDT to travel to Ceres.
NASA/DLR released imagerysummary information from a survey orbit, two high-altitude orbits (60 70 m/pixel)a low-altitude mapping orbit (20 m/pixel), including digital terrain models, videosatlases. Scientists also used Dawn to calculate Vesta's precise massgravity field. The subsequent determination ofJ2 component yielded a core diameter estimate of about 220 km assuming a crustal density similar to that ofHED.
Dawn data can be accessed bypublic atUCLA website.

Its sizeunusually bright surface make Vestabrightest asteroid,it is occasionally visible tonaked eye from dark skies (without light pollution). In MayJune 2007, Vesta reached a peak magnitude of +5.4,brightest since 1989. At that time, oppositionperihelion were only a few weeks apart.
Less favorable oppositions during late autumn 2008the Northern Hemisphere still had Vesta at a magnitude of from +6.5 to +7.3. Even whenconjunction withSun, Vesta will have a magnitude around +8.5; thus from a pollution-free sky it can be observed with binoculars even at elongations much smaller than near opposition.



In 2010, Vesta reached oppositionthe constellation of Leothe night of 17 18 February, at about magnitude 6.1, a brightness that makes it visiblebinocular range but generally not fornaked eye. Under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent it might be visible to an experienced observer withoutuse of a telescope or binoculars. Vesta came to opposition again5 August 2011,the constellation of Capricornus at about magnitude 5.6.



Vesta was at opposition again9 December 2012. According to SkyTelescope magazine, this year Vesta will come within about 6 degrees of 1 Ceres duringwinter of 2012spring 2013. Vesta orbitsSun3.63 yearsCeres4.6 years, so every 17 years Vesta overtakes Ceres (the last overtaking was1996). On December 1, 2012, Vesta had a magnitude of 6.6, but decreasing to 8.4 by May 1, 2013.
